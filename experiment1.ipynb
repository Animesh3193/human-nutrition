Anorexia nervosa is a potentially fatal\\ncondition characterized by under eating and excessive weight\\nloss. People with this disorder are preoccupied with dieting,\\ncalories, and food intake to an unhealthy degree. Anorexics\\nhave a poor body image, which leads to anxiety, avoidance of\\nfood, a rigid exercise regimen, fasting, and a denial of hunger.\\nThe condition predominantly affects females. Between 0.5 and\\n1 percent of American women and girls suffer from this eating\\ndisorder.\\n•\\nBinge-Eating Disorder. People who suffer from binge-eating\\ndisorder experience regular episodes of eating an extremely\\nlarge amount of food in a short period of time. Binge eating is a\\ncompulsive behavior, and people who suffer from it typically\\nfeel it is beyond their control. This behavior often causes\\nfeelings of shame and embarrassment, and leads to obesity,\\nhigh blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, Type 2 diabetes,\\nand other health problems.

Nutrients are substances\\nrequired by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must\\nbe obtained from our diet, since the human body does not\\nsynthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three\\nbasic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure,\\nand/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic\\nfunctions allow us to detect and respond to environmental\\nsurroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and\\nreproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body\\nto function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates,\\nlipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain\\nnon-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common\\nin plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or\\nbeneficial (such as antioxidants).\\n4 | Introduction\\n'},\n",

Smelling food sends a message to your brain.\\nYour brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to\\nsalivate in preparation for a meal.\\nOnce you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 “The\\nHuman Digestive System”) starts the process that breaks down the\\ncomponents of food into smaller components that can be absorbed\\nand taken into the body.

The smaller nutrient\\nmolecules can then be absorbed and processed by cells throughout\\nthe body for energy or used as building blocks for new cells. The\\ndigestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human\\nbody, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs\\nincluding the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine,\\nlarge intestine (colon), rectum, and anus.

The appendicular skeleton consists of\\nthe shoulder girdle, pelvic girdle, and upper and lower extremities,\\nand is composed of 126 bones. Bones are also categorized by size\\nand shape.

Body fat weighs less than muscle mass.\\nTherefore, BMI can sometimes underestimate the amount of body\\nfat in overweight or obese people and overestimate it in more\\nmuscular people. For instance, a muscular athlete will have more\\nmuscle mass (which is heavier than fat mass) than a sedentary\\nindividual of the same height. Based on their BMIs the muscular\\nathlete would be less “ideal” and may be categorized as more\\noverweight or obese than the sedentary individual; however this is\\nan infrequent problem with BMI calculation. Additionally, an older\\nperson with osteoporosis (decreased bone mass) will have a lower\\nBMI than an older person of the same height without osteoporosis,\\neven though the person with osteoporosis may have more fat mass.\\nBMI is a useful inexpensive tool to categorize people and is highly\\ncorrelative with disease risk, but other measurements are needed to\\ndiagnose obesity and more accurately assess disease risk.\\nBody Fat and Its Distribution\\nNext we’ll discuss how to measure body fat, and why distribution of\\nbody fat is also important to consider when determining health.\\nIndicators of Health: Body Mass Index, Body Fat Content, and Fat\\nDistribution | 135\\n'},\n",

Having more fat mass may be indicative of disease\\nrisk, but fat mass also varies with sex, age, and physical activity\\nlevel. Females have more fat mass, which is needed for reproduction\\nand, in part, is a consequence of different levels of hormones. The\\noptimal fat content of a female is between 20 and 30 percent of\\nher total weight and for a male is between 12 and 20 percent. Fat\\nmass can be measured in a variety of ways. The simplest and lowest-\\ncost way is the skin-fold test. A health professional uses a caliper to\\nmeasure the thickness of skin on the back, arm, and other parts of\\nthe body and compares it to standards to assess body fatness. It is\\na noninvasive and fairly accurate method of measuring fat mass, but\\nsimilar to BMI, is compared to standards of mostly young to middle-\\naged adults.\\nFigure 2.29 Measuring Skinfold Thickness Using Calipers\\nOther methods of measuring fat mass are more expensive and more\\ntechnically challenging.

In contrast to many minerals,\\nsodium absorption in the small intestine is extremely efficient and\\nin a healthy individual all excess sodium is excreted by the kidneys.\\nIn fact, very little sodium is required in the diet (about 200\\nmilligrams) because the kidneys actively reabsorb sodium. Kidney\\nreabsorption of sodium is hormonally controlled, allowing for a\\nrelatively constant sodium concentration in the blood.\\nOther Functions of Sodium in the Body\\nThe second notable function of sodium is in nerve impulse\\ntransmission.\\nNerve\\nimpulse\\ntransmission\\nresults\\nfrom\\nthe\\ntransport of sodium cations into a nerve cell, which creates a charge\\ndifference (or voltage) between the nerve cell and its extracellular\\nenvironment. Similar to how a current moves along a wire, a sodium\\ncurrent moves along a nerve cell. Stimulating a muscle contraction\\nalso involves the movement of sodium ions as well as other ion\\nmovements.\\nSodium is essential for nutrient absorption in the small intestine\\nand also for nutrient reabsorption in the kidney. Amino acids,\\nglucose and water must make their way from the small intestine to\\nthe blood. To do so, they pass through intestinal cells on their way\\nto the blood. The transport of nutrients through intestinal cells is\\nfacilitated by the sodium-potassium pump, which by moving sodium\\nout of the cell, creates a higher sodium concentration outside of the\\ncell (requiring ATP).\\n176 | Sodium\\n'},\n",

Ninety percent of potassium exists in intracellular fluid, with\\nabout 10 percent in extracellular fluid, and only 1 percent in blood\\nplasma. As with sodium, potassium levels in the blood are strictly\\nregulated. The hormone aldosterone is what primarily controls\\npotassium levels, but other hormones (such as insulin) also play\\na role. When potassium levels in the blood increase, the adrenal\\nglands release aldosterone. The aldosterone acts on the collecting\\nducts of kidneys, where it stimulates an increase in the number\\nof sodium-potassium pumps. Sodium is then reabsorbed and more\\npotassium\\nis\\nexcreted.\\nBecause\\npotassium\\nis\\nrequired\\nfor\\nmaintaining sodium levels, and hence fluid balance, about 200\\nmilligrams of potassium are lost from the body every day.\\nOther Functions of Potassium in the Body\\nNerve impulse involves not only sodium, but also potassium. A nerve\\nimpulse moves along a nerve via the movement of sodium ions into\\nthe cell. To end the impulse, potassium ions rush out of the nerve\\ncell, thereby decreasing the positive charge inside the nerve cell.\\nThis diminishes the stimulus. To restore the original concentrations\\nof ions between the intracellular and extracellular fluid, the sodium-\\npotassium pump transfers sodium ions out in exchange for\\npotassium\\nions\\nin.\\nOn\\ncompletion\\nof\\nthe\\nrestored\\nion\\nconcentrations, a nerve cell is now ready to receive the next\\nimpulse.

Caffeine is chemically similar to a chemical in\\nour brains (adenosine). Caffeine interacts with adenosine’s specific\\nprotein receptor. It blocks the actions of the adenosine, and affects\\nthe levels of signaling molecules in the brain, leading to an increase\\nin energy metabolism. At the molecular level, caffeine stimulates the\\nbrain, increasing alertness and causing a delay of fatigue and sleep.\\nAt high doses caffeine stimulates the motor cortex of the brain and\\ninterferes with the sleep-wake cycle, causing side effects such as\\nshakiness, anxiety, and insomnia. People’s sensitivity to the adverse\\neffects of caffeine varies and some people develop side effects at\\nmuch lower doses. The many effects caffeine has on the brain do\\nnot diminish with habitual drinking of caffeinated beverages.\\nTools for Change\\nConsuming caffeine in the evening and in the middle of the night\\nwill help keep you awake to study for an exam, but it will not\\nenhance your performance on the next day’s test if you do not get\\nenough sleep. Drink caffeinated beverages in moderation at any\\ntime of the day or evening to increase alertness (if you are not\\nsensitive to caffeine’s adverse effects), but get the recommended\\namount of sleep.\\nIt is important to note that caffeine has some effects on health\\nthat are either promoted or masked by the other beneficial\\n218 | Popular Beverage Choices\\n'},\n",

A diet of low-GI foods has been shown in epidemiological\\nand clinical trial studies to increase weight loss and reduce the risk\\nof obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.2\\n2.

Many cells prefer glucose as a source of energy versus\\nother compounds like fatty acids. Some cells, such as red blood\\ncells, are only able to produce cellular energy from glucose. The\\nbrain is also highly sensitive to low blood-glucose levels because\\nit uses only glucose to produce energy and function (unless under\\nextreme starvation conditions). About 70 percent of the glucose\\nentering the body from digestion is redistributed (by the liver) back\\ninto the blood for use by other tissues. Cells that require energy\\nremove the glucose from the blood with a transport protein in their\\nmembranes. The energy from glucose comes from the chemical\\nbonds between the carbon atoms. Sunlight energy was required to\\nproduce these high-energy bonds in the process of photosynthesis.\\nCells in our bodies break these bonds and capture the energy to\\nperform cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is basically a\\ncontrolled burning of glucose versus an uncontrolled burning.

Composed of fats and oils, lipids are molecules that yield\\nhigh energy and have a chemical composition mainly of carbon,\\nhydrogen, and oxygen. Lipids perform three primary biological\\nfunctions within the body: they serve as structural components of\\ncell membranes, function as energy storehouses, and function as\\nimportant signaling molecules.\\nThe three main types of lipids are triglycerides, phospholipids,\\nand sterols. Triglycerides make up more than 95 percent of lipids\\nin the diet and are commonly found in fried foods, vegetable oil,\\nbutter, whole milk, cheese, cream cheese, and some meats.\\nNaturally occurring triglycerides are found in many foods, including\\navocados, olives, corn, and nuts. We commonly call the triglycerides\\nin our food “fats” and “oils.” Fats are lipids that are solid at room\\ntemperature, whereas oils are liquid. As with most fats, triglycerides\\ndo not dissolve in water. The terms fats, oils, and triglycerides are\\ndiscretionary and can be used interchangeably. In this chapter when\\nwe use the word fat, we are referring to triglycerides.\\nPhospholipids make up only about 2 percent of dietary lipids.\\nThey are water-soluble and are found in both plants and animals.\\nPhospholipids are crucial for building the protective barrier, or\\nmembrane, around your body’s cells. In fact, phospholipids are\\nsynthesized in the body to form cell and organelle membranes. In\\nblood and body fluids, phospholipids form structures in which fat is\\nenclosed and transported throughout the bloodstream.\\nSterols are the least common type of lipid. Cholesterol is perhaps\\nthe best well-known sterol. Though cholesterol has a notorious\\nreputation, the body gets only a small amount of its cholesterol\\nthrough food—the body produces most of it.

Foods that are\\nhigh in fat contain more calories than foods high in protein or\\ncarbohydrates. As a result, high-fat foods are a convenient source\\nof energy. For example, 1 gram of fat or oil provides 9 kilocalories\\nof energy, compared with 4 kilocalories found in 1 gram of\\ncarbohydrate or protein. Depending on the level of physical activity\\nand on nutritional needs, fat requirements vary greatly from person\\nto person. When energy needs are high, the body welcomes the\\nhigh-caloric density of fats. For instance, infants and growing\\nchildren require proper amounts of fat to support normal growth\\nand development. If an infant or child is given a low-fat diet for\\nan extended period, growth and development will not progress\\nnormally. Other individuals with high-energy needs are athletes,\\npeople who have physically demanding jobs, and those recuperating\\nfrom illness.\\nWhen the body has used all of its calories from carbohydrates\\n(this can occur after just twenty minutes of exercise), it initiates\\nfat usage. A professional swimmer must consume large amounts of\\nfood energy to meet the demands of swimming long distances, so\\neating fat-rich foods makes sense. In contrast, if a person who leads\\na sedentary lifestyle eats the same high-density fat foods, they will\\nintake more fat calories than their body requires within just a few\\nbites. Use caution—consumption of calories over and beyond energy\\nrequirements is a contributing factor to obesity.\\nThe Role of Lipids in Food | 301\\n'},\n",

Do you think of heart disease, heart health, or\\natherosclerosis? Most people probably do not. As we uncover what\\nhydrogenation is and why manufacturers use it, you will be better\\nequipped to adhere to healthier dietary choices and promote your\\nheart health.\\nHydrogenation: The Good Gone Bad?\\nFood manufacturers are aware that fatty acids are susceptible to\\nattack by oxygen molecules because their points of unsaturation\\nrender them vulnerable in this regard. When oxygen molecules\\nattack these points of unsaturation the modified fatty acid becomes\\noxidized. The oxidation of fatty acids makes the oil rancid and gives\\nthe food prepared with it an unappetizing taste. Because oils can\\nundergo oxidation when stored in open containers, they must be\\nstored in airtight containers and possibly be refrigerated to\\nminimize damage from oxidation. Hydrogenation poses a solution\\nthat food manufacturers prefer.\\nWhen lipids are subjected to hydrogenation, the molecular\\nstructure of the fat is altered. Hydrogenation is the process of\\nadding hydrogen to unsaturated fatty-acid chains, so that the\\nhydrogen atoms are connected to the points of saturation and\\nresults in a more saturated fatty acid. Liquid oils that once\\ncontained more unsaturated fatty acids become semisolid or solid\\n(upon complete hydrogenation) and behave like saturated fats.

Some newer products are\\nnow using fully hydrogenated oil combined with nonhydrogenated\\nvegetable oils to create a usable fat.\\nManufacturers favor hydrogenation as a way to prevent oxidation\\nof oils and ensure longer shelf life. Partially hydrogenated vegetable\\noils are used in the fast food and processed food industries because\\nthey impart the desired texture and crispness to baked and fried\\nfoods. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are more resistant to\\nbreakdown from extremely hot cooking temperatures.

However, the trans fats that are used by the food\\nindustry are produced from the hydrogenation process.

A healthy diet\\nincorporates all nutrients in moderation. Low protein intake has\\nseveral health consequences, and a severe lack of protein in the\\ndiet eventually causes death. Although severe protein deficiency is\\na rare occurrence in children and adults in the United States, it\\nis estimated that more than half of the elderly in nursing homes\\nare protein-deficient. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution\\nRange (AMDR) for protein for adults is between 10 and 35 percent\\nof kilocalories, which is a fairly wide range. The percent of protein\\nin the diet that is associated with malnutrition and its health\\nconsequences is less than 10 percent, but this is often accompanied\\nby deficiencies in calories and other micronutrients. In this section\\nwe will discuss the health consequences of protein intake that is\\neither too low to support life’s processes or too high, thereby\\nincreasing the risk of chronic disease. In the last section of this\\nchapter, we will discuss in more detail the personal choices you can\\nmake to optimize your health by consuming the right amount of\\nhigh-quality protein.\\nHealth Consequences of Protein Deficiency\\nAlthough severe protein deficiency is rare in the developed world, it\\nis a leading cause of death in children in many poor, underdeveloped\\ncountries.

The name Kwashiorkor comes\\nfrom a language in Ghana and means, “rejected one.” The syndrome\\nwas named because it occurred most commonly in children who\\nhad recently been weaned from the breast, usually because another\\nchild had just been born. Subsequently the child was fed watery\\nporridge made from low-protein grains, which accounts for the low\\nprotein intake. Kwashiorkor is characterized by swelling (edema) of\\nthe feet and abdomen, poor skin health, growth retardation, low\\nmuscle mass, and liver malfunction. Recall that one of protein’s\\nfunctional roles in the body is fluid balance. Diets extremely low\\nin protein do not provide enough amino acids for the synthesis\\nof albumin. One of the functions of albumin is to hold water in\\nthe blood vessels, so having lower concentrations of blood albumin\\nresults in water moving out of the blood vessels and into tissues,\\ncausing swelling. The primary symptoms of Kwashiorkor include not\\nonly swelling, but also diarrhea, fatigue, peeling skin, and irritability.\\nSevere protein deficiency in addition to other micronutrient\\ndeficiencies, such as folate (vitamin B9), iodine, iron, and vitamin C\\nall contribute to the many health manifestations of this syndrome.\\nFigure 6.15 A Young Boy With Kwashiorkor\\n396 | Diseases Involving Proteins\\n'},\n",

The chemical breakdown of those chemicals provides the\\nenergy needed to carry out thousands of body functions that allow\\nthe body to perform daily functions and tasks such as breathing,\\nwalking up a flight of steps, and studying for a test.\\nEnergy is classified as either potential or kinetic. Potential energy\\nis stored energy, or energy waiting to happen. Kinetic energy is\\nenergy in motion. To illustrate this, think of an Olympic swimmer\\nstanding at the pool’s edge awaiting the sound of the whistle to\\nbegin the race. While he waits for the signal, he has potential\\nenergy. When the whistle sounds and he dives into the pool and\\nbegins to swim, his energy is kinetic (in motion).\\nIn food and in components of the human body, potential energy\\nresides in the chemical bonds of specific molecules such as\\ncarbohydrates, fats, proteins, and alcohol. This potential energy is\\nconverted into kinetic energy in the body that drives many body\\nfunctions ranging from muscle and nerve function to driving the\\nsynthesis of body protein for growth.

Retinol is the form of vitamin A found in animal-derived\\nfoods, and is converted in the body to the biologically active forms\\nof vitamin A: retinal and retinoic acid (thus retinol is sometimes\\nreferred to as “preformed vitamin A”). About 10 percent of plant-\\nderived carotenoids, including beta-carotene, can be converted in\\nthe body to retinoids and are another source of functional vitamin\\nA. Carotenoids are pigments synthesized by plants that give them\\ntheir yellow, orange, and red color. Over six hundred carotenoids\\nhave been identified and, with just a few exceptions, all are found\\nin the plant kingdom. There are two classes of carotenoids—the\\nxanthophylls, which contain oxygen, and the carotenes, which do\\nnot.\\nIn plants, carotenoids absorb light for use in photosynthesis and\\nact as antioxidants. Beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-\\ncryptoxanthin are converted to some extent to retinol in the body.\\nThe other carotenoids, such as lycopene, are not. Many biological\\nactions of carotenoids are attributed to their antioxidant activity,\\nbut they likely act by other mechanisms, too.\\nVitamin A is fat-soluble and is packaged into chylomicrons in\\nsmall intestine, and transported to the liver. The liver stores and\\nexports vitamin A as needed; it is released into the blood bound to a\\nretinol-binding protein, which transports it to cells.

Folic Acid however (that comes from\\nsupplements or fortified foods) is available to be used as active\\nfolate in the body without vitamin B12 .Therefore, if there is a\\ndeficiency in vitamin B12 macrocytic anemia may occur. With the\\nfortification of foods incorporated into people’s diets, the risk of an\\nindividual developing macrocytic anemia is decreased.\\n584 | Water-Soluble Vitamins\\n'},\n",

Although only 1 percent of\\nthe calcium in the human body is found in the blood and soft tissues,\\nit is here that it performs the most critical functions. Blood calcium\\nlevels are rigorously controlled so that if blood levels drop the body\\nwill rapidly respond by stimulating bone resorption, thereby\\nreleasing stored calcium into the blood. Thus, bone tissue sacrifices\\nits stored calcium to maintain blood calcium levels. This is why bone\\nhealth is dependent on the intake of dietary calcium and also why\\nblood levels of calcium do not always correspond to dietary intake.\\nCalcium plays a role in a number of different functions in the\\nbody like bone and tooth formation. The most well-known calcium\\nfunction is to build and strengthen bones and teeth. Recall that\\nwhen bone tissue first forms during the modeling or remodeling\\nprocess, it is unhardened, protein-rich osteoid tissue. In the\\nosteoblast-directed\\nprocess\\nof\\nbone\\nmineralization,\\ncalcium\\nphosphates (salts) are deposited on the protein matrix. The calcium\\nsalts typically make up about 65 percent of bone tissue. When your\\ndiet is calcium deficient, the mineral content of bone decreases\\ncausing it to become brittle and weak. Thus, increased calcium\\nintake helps to increase the mineralized content of bone tissue.\\nGreater mineralized bone tissue corresponds to a greater BMD,\\nand to greater bone strength. The remaining calcium plays a role\\nin nerve impulse transmission by facilitating electrical impulse\\ntransmission from one nerve cell to another. Calcium in muscle cells\\nCalcium | 613\\n'},\n",

For example, without calcium, the hormone\\ninsulin could not be released from cells in the pancreas and\\nglycogen could not be broken down in muscle cells and used to\\nprovide energy for muscle contraction.\\nMaintaining Calcium Levels\\nBecause calcium performs such vital functions in the body, blood\\ncalcium level is closely regulated by the hormones parathyroid\\nhormone (PTH), calcitriol, and calcitonin. When blood calcium levels\\nare low, PTH is secreted to increase blood calcium levels via three\\ndifferent mechanisms. First, PTH stimulates the release of calcium\\nstored in the bone. Second, PTH acts on kidney cells to increase\\ncalcium reabsorption and decrease its excretion in the urine. Third,\\nPTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that activate vitamin D to\\ncalcitriol. Calcitriol is the active hormone that acts on the intestinal\\ncells and increases dietary calcium absorption. When blood calcium\\nlevels become too high, the hormone calcitonin is secreted by\\ncertain cells in the thyroid gland and PTH secretion stops. At higher\\nnonphysiological concentrations, calcitonin lowers blood calcium\\nlevels by increasing calcium excretion in the urine, preventing\\nfurther absorption of calcium in the gut and by directly inhibiting\\nbone resorption.\\nFigure 10.2 Maintaining Blood Calcium Levels\\n614 | Calcium\\n'},\n",

The percentage of Daily Value (percent DV)\\nrepresents the proportion of the total daily recommended amount\\nthat you will get from one serving of the food. For example, in the\\nolder food label in Figure 12.2 “Reading the Older Nutrition Label,”\\nthe percent DV of calcium for one serving of macaroni-and-cheese\\nis 20 percent, which means that one serving of macaroni and cheese\\nprovides 20 percent of the daily recommended calcium intake.

Whether you consume 2,000 calories per day or not you can\\nstill use the percent DV as a target reference.\\nGenerally, a percent DV of 5 is considered low and a percent\\nDV of 20 is considered high. This means, as a general rule, for fat,\\nsaturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium, look for foods with\\na low percent DV. Alternatively, when concentrating on essential\\nmineral or vitamin intake, look for a high percent DV.

In addition, breast\\nmilk is rich in cholesterol, which is needed for brain development. It\\nis helpful to know the different types and components of breastmilk,\\nalong with the nutrients they provide to enable an infant to survive\\nand thrive.\\nColostrum is the milk produced immediately after birth, prior\\nto the start of mature milk production, and lasts for two to five\\ndays after the arrival of the baby. Cells in the breast can begin to\\nsecrete colostrum by mid-pregnancy. During the last trimester, the\\nalveoli (grape-like clusters of cells that produce milk) can become\\nswollen with colostrum. Colostrum is thicker than mature breast\\nmilk, and is yellowish or creamy in color. This protein-rich liquid\\nfulfills an infant’s nutrient needs during those early days. Although\\nlow in volume, colostrum is packed with concentrated nutrition for\\nnewborns. This special milk is high in fat-soluble vitamins, minerals,\\nand immunoglobulins (antibodies) that pass from the mother to the\\nbaby. Immunoglobulins provide passive immunity for the newborn\\nand protect the baby from bacterial and viral diseases.16 Colostrum\\nalso helps the baby to eliminate waste (meconium).\\nTwo to four days after birth, colostrum is replaced by transitional\\nmilk. Nursing the baby early (within the first hour of birth) and\\nfrequently (8 to 14 times per 24 hours) helps to bring in this\\nincreased volume of milk sooner. Transitional milk is a creamy,\\nusually yellow liquid that lasts for approximately two weeks and\\nincludes high levels of fat, lactose, and water-soluble vitamins. It\\n16.

Another contributing factor is a lack of access\\nto fresh fruits and vegetables. This is a problem particularly in low-\\nincome neighborhoods where local stores and markets may not\\nstock fresh produce or may have limited options.

The combination of increased energy\\noutput, energy expenditure and basal needs over a long period of\\ntime can have a major impact on total energy expenditure (see\\nFigure 16.2 “The Effect of Physical Activity on Energy Expenditure”).\\nThe more energy you expend, the more foods you are able to\\nconsume while maintaining a healthy weight. Any improvement to\\nmetabolic fitness is beneficial and means a decrease in the risk for\\ndeveloping diabetes, or other chronic conditions.\\nOne measurement of metabolic fitness is basal metabolic rate, or\\nBMR, which is a measurement of the amount of energy required for\\nthe body to maintain its basic functions while at rest, i.e. breathing,\\nheart beats, liver and kidney function, and so on. On average, BMR\\naccounts for between 50 and 70 percent of a person’s total daily\\nenergy expenditure. Different factors can affect the BMR. For\\nexample, a slender person who is tall has more body surface area\\nand therefore has a higher RMR relative to their body mass (weight).\\nAlso, muscle utilizes more energy at rest than fat, so a person with\\nmore muscle mass has a higher BMR.\\nA second measurement of metabolic fitness is the number of\\ncalories burned during physical activity. The amount of calories\\nburned depends on how much oxygen is delivered to tissues, and\\nhow efficiently metabolic reactions consume oxygen and, therefore,\\nexpend calories. One of the best estimates of energy expenditure\\nduring exercise is how much oxygen a person consumes. Recall that\\nVO2 max is a measure of the maximum cardiorespiratory capacity\\nto deliver oxygen to the body, especially to working muscles during\\nexercise.. Greater VO2 max is indicative of better cardiovascular\\nfitness. In contrast to RMR, VO2 max increases significantly with\\nexercise training due to training adaptations that increase the\\nbody’s ability to deliver oxygen to working tissues and an increased\\ncapacity of muscles to take up and utilize oxygen.\\nFigure 16.2 The Effect of Physical Activity on Energy Expenditure\\nThe Essential Elements of Physical Fitness | 941\\n'},\n",

These essential nutrients are needed\\nregardless of the intensity of activity you are doing. If you are lying\\ndown reading a book or running the the Honolulu Marathon, these\\nmacronutrients are always needed in the body. However, in order\\nfor these nutrients to be used as fuel for the body, their energy must\\nbe transferred into the high energy molecule known as Adenosine\\nTriphosphate (ATP). ATP is the body’s immediate fuel source of\\nenergy that can be generated either with the presences of oxygen\\nknown as aerobic metabolism or without the presence of oxygen\\nby\\nanaerobic\\nmetabolism.\\nThe\\ntype\\nof\\nmetabolism\\nthat\\nis\\npredominately used during physical activity is determined by the\\navailability of oxygen and how much carbohydrate, fat, and protein\\nare used.\\nAnaerobic and Aerobic Metabolism\\nAnaerobic metabolism occurs in the cytosol of the muscle cells. As\\nseen in Figure 16.2 “Anaerobic versus Aerobic Metabolism”, a small\\namount of ATP is produced in the cytosol without the presence of\\noxygen. Anaerobic metabolism uses glucose as its only source of fuel\\nand produces pyruvate and lactic acid. Pyruvate can then be used as\\nfuel for aerobic metabolism. Aerobic metabolism takes place in the\\nmitochondria of the cell and is able to use carbohydrates, protein or\\nfat as its fuel source. Aerobic metabolism is a much slower process\\nthan anaerobic metabolism but produces majority of the ATP.\\nFigure 16.3 Anaerobic versus Aerobic Metabolism\\n950 | Fuel Sources\\n'},\n",

The physiology underlying “hitting the wall” means that\\nmuscles have used up all their stored glycogen and are therefore\\ndependent on other nutrients to support their energy needs. Fatty\\nacids are transported from fat-storing cells to the muscle to rectify\\nthe nutrient deficit. However, fatty acids take more time to convert\\nto energy than glucose, thus decreasing performance levels. To\\navoid “hitting the wall” or “bonking,” endurance athletes load up\\non carbohydrates for a few days before the event, known as\\ncarbohydrate loading. This will maximize an athlete’s amount of\\nglycogen stored in their liver and muscle tissues. It is important not\\nto assume that carbohydrate loading works for everyone. Without\\naccompanied endurance training you will not increase the amount\\nof stored glucose. If you plan on running a five-mile race for fun\\nwith your friend and decide to eat a large amount of carbohydrates\\nin the form of a big spaghetti dinner the night before, the excess\\ncarbohydrates will be stored as fat.

These types of carbohydrate foods are rapidly\\ndigested and absorbed. Blood glucose levels rise quickly causing a\\nspike in insulin levels. Contrastingly, foods containing high amounts\\nof fiber are like time-release capsules of sugar. A measurement\\nof the effects of a carbohydrate-containing food on blood-glucose\\nlevels is called the glycemic response.\\nGlycemic Index\\nThe glycemic responses of various foods have been measured and\\nthen ranked in comparison to a reference food, usually a slice of\\nwhite bread or just straight glucose, to create a numeric value called\\nthe glycemic index (GI). Foods that have a low GI do not raise blood-\\nglucose levels neither as much nor as fast as foods that have a\\nhigher GI. A diet of low-GI foods has been shown in epidemiological\\nand clinical trial studies to increase weight loss and reduce the risk\\nof obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.2\\n2.

    "Query: What are the fat-soluble vitamins?\n",
    "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",
    "\\nExample 2:\n",
    "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
    "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
    "\\nExample 3:\n",
    "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
    "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",
